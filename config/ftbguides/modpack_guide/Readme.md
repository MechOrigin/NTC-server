This is Not too Complicated... It's a modpack centered around trying to become creative mode, but not overly complicated and hectic. With an almost perfectly balanced EMC system.

Also, the Beneath/End/Nether/Space can't be accessed from the void world. Which is the Skyblock.

Here is where you will find all our guides and information on automation. Our community has been a wonderful help in finding bugs and adding to the efficiency of this pack. Thank you all!


Without these people this pack wouldn't quite be what it is today:
