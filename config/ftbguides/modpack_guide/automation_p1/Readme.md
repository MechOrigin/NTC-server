Automation Part 1:
-------------
###Optional

####Once you've got the Atomic Resonstructor you can start the bases for early game automation.

1) Proceed through the quest book into logic cables if you haven't already and start setting up an integrated dynamics network.

2) A logic programmer will be able to write logic for those variable cards and once a Crafting Interface is made can be ordered up in the Storage Terminal. Simply set up a recipe in the logic programmer and put it inside the crafting interface.

3) The output variable transformers require Auto-breaker and input requires Auto-placer.

4) Once you've got that pretty much set up you can set up Item Interfaces, importers and exporters to objects that you want to automate.
