Getting Steel:
-------------

The process of getting steel is not easy at first.

1) First you must construct a coke oven from Immersive Engineering. It's the only way early game to get coal coke.

2) Then you must construct a blast furnace from Immersive Engineering and use all that coal coke and iron to make steel.

3) Later on you can get Mystical Agriculture Steel seeds which is probably the best way.

4) Various machines such as the metallurgic infuser, alloy furnace, electric/arc furnace can also create steel.

Note: Save all that creosote oil you get from the blast furnace, you will need it for actually additions next, and other things later on in immersive engineering!
