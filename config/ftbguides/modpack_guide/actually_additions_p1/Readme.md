Actually Additions Part 1:
-------------

####Once you have a decent amount of solidified xp, you can liquify it (tinkers smeltery) and pour it over any obsidian dust. This will create the necessary powder to make Petrotheum Dust!

1) Petrotheum Dust can be automated more later game. A fluid transposer, and to get the Basalz Powder, Mystical Agriculture or a Basalz mob farm are some of the ways to get this.

2) Once you have that sorted, you can get your first Black Quartz by pouring that liquid petrotheum over nether quartz (smelter again).

3) You will need this black quartz for all these Iron Casings(actuallyadditions) to make the machines necessary to progress forward.

4) Remember all that Creosote oil you gathered from making steel? Get a bucket and cover some wood in creosote in a crafting table, you will need it to make the Iron Casings.

5) The next logical step is to make an Atomic Reconstructor. This will require power though so maybe try using integrated dynamics generator or something. You will need Enori Crystals, Restonia, Ethetic Green/Quartz to make the Empowerer and 4 Display Stands next.
