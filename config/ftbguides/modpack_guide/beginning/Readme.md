The beginning:
-------------

You will start on a little island with a Tomb of Knowledge, a Watch of Flowing Time (WoFT from here on out) and a Philosophers Stone.

Insert the Tomb of Knowledge into the Transmutation Table for your first 500 EMC.

-----------

####Next what you will want to do is get an EMC source.

Do your best to make a Crook and get some leaves from the Transmutation Tablet and break them with the crook for a higher chance to get saplings.

###The best leaves to start off with:

####Menril:
Starting Integrated Dynamics, berries as early food.

####Jungle/Oak:
Drops Cocoa beans and apples respectively.

####Bonsai pots and Magma Slimy Dirt:
12.5% grow time - 87.5% increase in speed than from Grass!
300% drop chance - 200% increase in drops than from Grass!

#####â†‘ Equals a lot of slime which can be converted to regular green slime with a compacting drawer or Integrated Dynamics or something.
