Mob Farm:
-------------

####While you're waiting for steel, make a mob farm to collect all that solidified xp, inferium and loot!

1) Set up some area around 16 blocks away (or more) from your "working" area and make a decent sized large room. Blocking all outside light coming in.
   
2) Mobs will spawn and if you use vector plates on the ground to direct them to a single point it will be much easier to kill them.
   
3) Not only do you get solidified xp from mobs but also quests, it's the only early game source to make all that blaze powder and other recipes that require liquid xp.
   
4) Later on, you can create mob crushers and kill them automatically to collect their loot.
