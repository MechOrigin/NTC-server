Removed combiner(mekanism) recipe for klein stars because it doesn't work.
Needed a solution to reduce AE2 autocrafting extreme. Created a modular machine to quickly make stars.
Modular machine:
Dark Matter Collapsing Engine:
	Input:
	1 x Dark Matter
	Output:
	5 x Ein Star
	2 x Aeternalis Fuel
	Quick Omega:
	Input:
	48 x Dark Matter Block
	Output: 
	192 x Aeternalis Fuel
	1 x Omega Star


	Second function:
	Input:
	4 x any Star
	Output:
	1 x next Star in chain
